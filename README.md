#Isomorphic React App Generator
Barebones Isomorphic React App to bootstrap your React projects. 

  npm i isomorphic-react-app-generator

## Webpack + Babel + React + Redux + ExpressJS + BrowserSync + postCSS = Isomorphic React App Generator
Highly inspired from [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) and  [Isomorphic React Example](https://github.com/DavidWells/isomorphic-react-example).

Enjoy!
